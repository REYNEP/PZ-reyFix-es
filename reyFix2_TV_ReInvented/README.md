Original Mod by tealera:- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3420581050

1. fixed TV & Radio ReInvented + BetterSorting issue in Multiplayer --> https://reynep.github.io/PZ/reyFix2

2. All other MultiPlayer issues with Vanilla RADIO / TV / WalkieTalkie items should be fixed as a sideEffect too.

3. The original mod is not compatible with items outside of Vanilla. However, I am planning to make it compatible with other newer Radio Items too. Comment the mod that you'd like support for. Thank you. I can't promise that i will be forever active on steam. But I will forever, at least be on github. Search "REYNEP"
